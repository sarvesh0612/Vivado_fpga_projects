# Vending Machine Controller – FSM Based Design

This project implements a **High level state machine (HLSM)** based vending machine controller using Verilog HDL.

## Description
The system accepts multiple coin inputs, calculates the total amount, dispenses a product when sufficient balance is reached, and handles reset conditions.

## Features
- HLSM-based control logic
- Multiple coin input handling
- Product dispense logic
- Reset and balance tracking

## HLSM Design
- Separate Datapath & Control
- Idle state
- Coin acceptance states
- Product dispense state
- Reset state

## Tools Used
- Verilog HDL
- Xilinx Vivado

## Applications
- FSM design practice
- Embedded control systems
- Digital system modeling
