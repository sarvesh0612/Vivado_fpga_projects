# Wallace Tree Multiplier (4×4) – Verilog

This project implements a **4×4 Wallace Tree Multiplier**, optimized for high-speed arithmetic operations.

## Description
The Wallace Tree approach reduces multiplication delay by using **parallel partial product reduction** with carry-save adders.

## Features
- Faster multiplication compared to array multipliers
- Reduced propagation delay
- Structured CSA-based reduction stages

## Design Components
- Partial product generator
- Carry Save Adders (CSA)
- Final carry-propagate adder

## Tools Used
- Verilog HDL
- Xilinx Vivado

## Applications
- High-speed arithmetic units
- FPGA and ASIC datapaths
