- Reduced number of additions
- Arithmetic shift operations
- Efficient RTL implementation

## Design Components
- Booth encoder
- Partial product generator
- Accumulation and shifting logic

## Tools Used
- Verilog HDL
- Xilinx Vivado

## Applications
- Signed arithmetic units
- Processor datapaths
- DSP systems
- FPGA-based arithmetic blocks
