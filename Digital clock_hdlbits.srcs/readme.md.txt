# 12-Hour Digital Clock with AM/PM – Verilog

This project implements a **12-hour digital clock** with **AM/PM indication**, designed using Verilog HDL.

## Description
The clock uses BCD counters for seconds, minutes, and hours.  
A control signal increments time once per second.

## Features
- 12-hour format
- AM/PM indicator
- BCD counters
- Synchronous reset
- Modular counter design

## Design Components
- Seconds counter
- Minutes counter
- Hours counter
- AM/PM control logic

## Tools Used
- Verilog HDL
- Xilinx Vivado

## Applications
- Timekeeping systems
- Counter-based digital designs
- FPGA-based clock systems
