# Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) on FPGA

This project implements a **Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS)** system on FPGA to optimize power consumption based on workload conditions.

## Description
The system dynamically adjusts the operating frequency using control logic and clock management techniques.  
Workload detection logic determines when to scale performance up or down.

## Implemented on Basys 3 Board.

## Key Features
- Workload-based frequency scaling
- FSM-based control unit
- Power-aware design approach
- FPGA-compatible RTL implementation

## Design Components
- DVFS Controller FSM
- Clock / Frequency control logic
- Workload detection logic

## Tools Used
- Verilog HDL
- Xilinx Vivado

## Applications
- Low-power embedded systems
- Power-efficient FPGA designs
- Research in energy-aware computing
